# 🏥 Workforce Cost Efficiency Dashboard  
**For Clinical and Administrative Hospital Teams**

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project delivers an interactive, visual dashboard to analyze workforce efficiency across hospital departments. It tracks staffing costs, productivity, and adjusted patient output using real-world hospital data from California (2009–2013). The goal is to uncover cost drivers, identify inefficiencies, and provide actionable strategies to optimize labor utilization in both clinical and administrative settings.

##  Dashboard Features  
-  **KPI Cards**: Total labor cost, total productive hours, avg. cost per adjusted patient day
-  **Charts**: 
  - Labor Cost by Role (Bar Chart)  
  - Total Productive Hours by Role (Pie Chart)  
  - Avg. Cost per Adjusted Patient Day by Year (Line Chart)
- 🔍 **Breakdown Tables**:
  - Labor cost and hours by role
  - Efficiency metrics by year
- 📎 **Executive Summary**: Strategic insights and optimization recommendations

##  Key Insights
- Registered Nurses and Daily Cost Centers carry most of the workload.
- Administrative roles and contracted labor contribute high cost with lower relative output.
- Avg. cost per adjusted patient day increased significantly despite flat productivity.

##  Strategic Recommendations
- Reallocate underutilized admin/support roles
- Reduce dependence on high-cost contracted staff
- Invest in automation for clerical workflows
- Implement performance-based or predictive scheduling

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Google Sheets** – Interactive dashboard & charts
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and KPI calculation
- **California HCAI Public Dataset** – Source: [data.chhs.ca.gov](https://data.chhs.ca.gov)
